# Criminal Record Database Management

### Introduction ✨✨

According to the World Prison Brief, there are over 10 million people incarcerated worldwide, with more than 2 million in the United States alone. However, many of these prisoners have inaccurate or incomplete criminal records that affect their chances of rehabilitation and reintegration into society. How can we ensure that criminal records are reliable, secure, and accessible for all stakeholders involved in the criminal justice system?
This project (Criminal Record Database Management) helps us to create an Application which deals with the problem of evidentiary consistency about the criminals. 

## Current Challenges and Limitations

- **Information Overload**: Large amount of data are generated and collected by various agencies and stockholders involved in the criminal justice system. This data may be in different formats, languages, and standards, and may be stored in different locations and systems. Managing and integrating this data can be difficult and time-consuming.
- **Cost**: Creating and managing a database is quite costly. High cost software and hardware is required for the database. Moreover, there is a need to hire and train qualified staff to maintain and operate the database. Additionally, there may be other expenses related to security, backup, maintenance, upgrade, etc.
- **Corruption and extortion**: There may be cases where some authorized or unauthorized personnel may manipulate or misuse the criminal records for their own benefit or agenda. For example, they may alter, delete, or fabricate records to favor or harm certain individuals or groups. They may also demand or accept bribes or favors in exchange for access or information on criminal records.

## How Blockchain Technology address these issue

👉 A peer-to-peer cloud network enables the decentralization of data making modification of any criminal nearly impossible.
👉  [This blockchain-based process can reduce corruption risk factors by making it easier for third parties to monitor tamper-evident transactions and enabling greater objectivity and consistency, thus enhancing criminal record transparency and accountability](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/954465)


## Tool we are going to use 🪛

🖼️ FrontEnd - ReactJS and NextJS
🔩 BackEnd - Web3js , Solidity , ExpressJs and NodeJs , MongoDB


## Motivation for this project 💪
In 2018, a man named Sholom We­iss faced arrest and charges for orche­strating a massive Ponzi scheme that re­sulted in defrauding investors of ove­r $1 billion. Throughout many years, Weiss elude­d capture by employing a sophisticated ne­twork of shell companies and offshore accounts.

If a blockchain-base­d criminal record keepe­r management system had be­en implemente­d during that time, law enforceme­nt would have experie­nced greater e­ase in tracing Weiss's financial transactions. This system would have­ meticulously logged all cryptocurrency de­alings, facilitating the detection of the­ clandestine entitie­s and offshore holdings utilized by Weiss.

Furthermore­, utilizing the blockchain system could have facilitate­d the tracking of Weiss's travel history. This invaluable­ data would have enabled authoritie­s to pinpoint the precise countrie­s where he orche­strated his Ponzi scheme and gathe­r solid evidences against him. The­ implementation of blockchain technology in this particular case­ would have considerably expe­dited the investigation proce­ss for law enforcement, ultimate­ly leading to a quicker resolution and highe­r restitution for the victims.


## Teammates Roles 
### Front End 🎨 ( ReactJs and NextJs)

- Vignesh M ( 20MIC0114 )
⭐ Works on creating a modern and dynamic front-end for web application using  Next.js, React.js, and Tailwind CSS for UI/UX design

### Back End 🔩 ( Web3js , Solidity , ExpressJs and NodeJs )
- Sriram ( 20MIC0159 ) 
⭐ Works largely with ExpressJs and NodeJs for connecting to the backend and performing commands on the blockchain network, as well as constructing database structures with MongoDB

- Joseph John Philip ( 20MIC0140 )
⭐ Works on Refining the Overall Design and implementing the smart contracts on the blockchain network (🪙 Ethereum )

## Requirements for the Site 

### Login Page 👤

- Four Type of Users (Policeman , Judicary , Organization) . Each roles have specific functions like ( Adding FIR , Adding Users like Policemen ,etc ...)
- User Name and Password 

### DashBaord Page 🏠:
- Filing FIR, Case 
- Searching and finding case Details 
- User Management

All of these options are solely determined by the role of the individual who has signed in

### 🌿 Separate branch on GitHub repo

A separate branch has been created on the repository to facilitate project flow management.

| Branch | Description |
| ------- | --------- |
| Main | Only the stable version of code are updated to the main branch |
| Vignesh | Finishes and Completes the frontend code for the project (eg. Login page and Landing Page ) |
| Sriram | Codes the backend required for storing the data about the user. Quickly works on the backend begins as soon as the login page frontend finishes in the "vignesh" branch. In the meantime rest of the front end is refined in vignesh branch |
| Joseph (Team Leader)|  Solely works on blockchain development using Truffle, Web3Js and Solidity. Refines frontend and backend to maximize stability of the project  |
