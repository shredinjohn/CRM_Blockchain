# Criminal Record Database Management

### Introduction ✨

According to the World Prison Brief, there are over 10 million people incarcerated worldwide, with more than 2 million in the United States alone. However, many of these prisoners have inaccurate or incomplete criminal records that affect their chances of rehabilitation and reintegration into society. How can we ensure that criminal records are reliable, secure, and accessible for all stakeholders involved in the criminal justice system?
This project (Criminal Record Database Management) helps us to create an Application which deals with the problem of evidentiary consistency about the criminals. 

## Current Challenges and Limitations

- **Information Overload**: Large amount of data are generated and collected by various agencies and stockholders involved in the criminal justice system. This data may be in different formats, languages, and standards, and may be stored in different locations and systems. Managing and integrating this data can be difficult and time-consuming.
- **Cost**: Creating and managing a database is quite costly. High cost software and hardware is required for the database. Moreover, there is a need to hire and train qualified staff to maintain and operate the database. Additionally, there may be other expenses related to security, backup, maintenance, upgrade, etc.
- **Corruption and extortion**: There may be cases where some authorized or unauthorized personnel may manipulate or misuse the criminal records for their own benefit or agenda. For example, they may alter, delete, or fabricate records to favor or harm certain individuals or groups. They may also demand or accept bribes or favors in exchange for access or information on criminal records.

## How Blockchain Technology address these issue

👉 A peer-to-peer cloud network enables the decentralization of data making modification of any criminal nearly impossible.
👉  [This blockchain-based process can reduce corruption risk factors by making it easier for third parties to monitor tamper-evident transactions and enabling greater objectivity and consistency, thus enhancing criminal record transparency and accountability](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/954465)
