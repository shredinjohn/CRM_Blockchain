### Introduction ✨✨

According to global statistics, the world of crowdfunding using blockchain has witnessed tremendous growth, with millions of contributors actively participating in diverse projects. However, concerns about trust, security, and transparency persist. In this context, we must address the question: How can we ensure a trustworthy and decentralized crowdfunding system using blockchain technology that benefits all stakeholders involved in the fundraising process?


## *Current Challenges and Limitations*

- *Information Overload*: The world of blockchain-based crowdfunding faces a deluge of data, with a plethora of projects, contributors, and transactions in different formats and standards. These data streams are often scattered across various platforms and may present language and interoperability challenges, posing complexities in data management and analysis.
- *Cost*: Implementing and maintaining a robust blockchain-based crowdfunding platform involves substantial expenses. This includes investments in blockchain technology, smart contract development, and security measures. Additionally, there is a need to onboard and educate personnel for effective platform operation. Ongoing costs related to security, auditing, and updates further add to the financial burden.
- *Integrity and Fraud*: In the realm of blockchain-powered crowdfunding, there's a concern about data integrity and fraudulent activities. Malicious actors may attempt to manipulate or exploit the blockchain for personal gain. For instance, they could engage in fraudulent activities, misrepresent project information, or engage in deceptive practices. Ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the platform is critical.
